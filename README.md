## Five Steps to a Technical Question
1. Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity
2. Design an algorithm
3. Write pseudocode first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you'll eventually write "real" code
4. Write your code at a moderate pace
5. Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes

## Five Algorithm Approaches
1. Examplify - Write out specific examples of the problem and see if you can derive a general rule from there
2. Pattern Matching
3. Simplify and Generalize
4. Base Case and Build
5. Data Structure Brainstorm

## What Good Coding Looks Like
- Correct

- Simple
- Readable
- Maintainable
